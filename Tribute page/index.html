            Some facts from Mandela's life:
        </h1>
        <section id="tribute-info">
            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nelson Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo on 18 July 1918</li>
                <li>When he was born, his name was Rolihlahla Mandela and his birth name means "to pull a branch off a
                    tree" and "troublemaker."</li>
                <li>Nelson was the youngest son of Mphakanyiswa, who had four wives and thirteen children (four boys and
                    nine girls).</li>
                <li>Mphakanyiswa served as a counselor to Jongintaba Dalindyebo, the acting king of South Africa's
                    Thembu tribe.</li>
                <li>After his father's death, Nelson became the ward of Jongintaba and was raised in the acting king's
                    palace.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mandela was given the name Nelson as a seven-year-old student in a Qunu primary school. (It was
                    customary for schoolchildren to be given Christian names).</li>
                <li>After completing secondary school, he enrolled in Fort Hare Missionary College to seek a B.A.
                    degree.</li>
                <li>He was thrown out of Fort Hare in 1940 for organizing a strike against the white rule of the
                    college.</li>
                <li>He earned his B.A. degree in 1943 from Fort Hare, though he completed his coursework through the
                    University of South Africa.</li>
                <li>He then studied law at the University of Witwatersrand. He earned a two-year diploma in law (which
                    allowed him to practice law) but did not earn an LLB degree.</li>
                <li>In 1944, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) and played a pivotal role in forming the
                    ANC Youth League.</li>
                <li>In 1952, he became leader of the Defiance Campaign, speaking out through civil disobedience against
                    South Africa's unjust apartheid practices.</li>
                <li>Also in 1952, he and Tambo (his friend from Fort Hare) formed Mandela & Tambo, South Africa's first
                    Black-owned law firm.</li>
                <li>He was arrested and tried several times for his activism against the country's unjust system of
                    racial segregation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Mandela's Imprisonment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1964, Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison. He served 27 years of that sentence before
                    being released in 1990.</li>
                <li>He was imprisoned on Robben Island for 18 years before being moved to two other South African
                    prisons.</li>
                <li>In 1968, both his mother and son passed away. However, he was not permitted out of prison to attend
                    their funerals. His only son passed away due to AIDS.</li>
                <li>During his time in prison, he was able to have secret talks with F. W. de Klerk, the President of
                    South Africa. Due to these talks, he was able to be freed.</li>
                <li>In 1989, toward the end of his time in prison, Mandela earned his LLB degree from the University of
                    South Africa.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>From Prison to South Africa's Presidency</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Upon his release from prison, Mandela quickly rose to a leadership role in the African National
                    Conference (ANC), then was elected to serve as president of South Africa.</li>
                <li>He was elected Deputy President of the ANC in 1990.</li>
                <li>In 1992, he was elected President of the ANC.</li>
                <li>In 1993, Mandela shared the Nobel Peace Prize with F.W. de Klerk. They received this Nobel Peace
                    Prize for getting rid of the apartheid system.</li>
                <li>
                    In 1994, he became the first president of South Africa to be elected by a democratic election in
                    which the African National Congress was allowed to participate.
                </li>
                <li>Once he was finished with his presidency, he became an advocate in support of people suffering from
                    AIDS.</li>
            </ul>

                “I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he
                who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.” - N. Mandela
